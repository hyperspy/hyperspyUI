Installation
=============

There are several ways to install HyperSpyUI. The application itself is rather
simple to install, but its dependencies can be a bit more tricky.

Bundle Installer
-----------------

If you're on Windows, the quickest way to get set up is to download and install
the `HyperSpy bundle`_ installer.

.. _HyperSpy bundle: https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-bundle


Install via `conda`
-------------------

HyperSpyUI can also be installed in an Anaconda_ or Miniconda_ distribution
using ``conda``:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge hyperspyui


.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
.. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html


Install via `pip`
-----------------

HyperSpyUI is on PyPI_, so simply run the command

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
   pip install hyperspyui


which will download and install HyperSpyUI and its dependencies. The package defines
a GUI script ``hyperspyui``, which can be called to start the application, or
alternatively it can be started by running ``python -m hyperspyui``.

To get HyperSpyUI to integrate with your operating system after installation,
run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m hyperspyui.desktop_integration


Append the ``--help`` flag for other options.

Currently, this only integrates with Windows and Linux, but this is intended to 
be extend to MacOS systems in the future (please consider contributing).

Getting Qt
""""""""""
Getting and installing Qt_ might or might not be easy, depending on which
operating system you are on. For this reason, it is recommended to run
HyperSpyUI on a distribution which offers ready-made Qt packages. Examples
include WinPython_, Anaconda_ and Miniconda_.

.. _Qt: https://www.qt.io/
