HyperSpyUI tries to bring a streamlined user interface to the powerful
multi-dimensional analysis capabilities of HyperSpy_. HyperSpy is an open
source Python library which provides tools to facilitate data analysis of
multidimensional datasets.

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures
that operate on an individual signal to multidimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multidimensionality
of the dataset.

While the UI tries to create a simple and intuitive interface to HyperSpy, it
still retains the raw power of HyperSpy via the UIâ€™s built in IPython console,
which runs on the same Python kernel as the UI.


Installation
=============
There are several ways to install HyperSpyUI. The application itself is rather
simple to install, but its dependencies can be a bit more tricky.

Bundle Installer
----------------
If you're on Windows, the quickest way to get set up is to download and install
the HyperSpyUI bundle installer. The bundled WinPython_ distribution includes
all the dependencies of the program, and the installer also helps create
program shortucts and register common microscopy file formats with the
application.

The bundle installer can also be used if you already have installed a WinPython
distribution (e.g. via the `HyperSpy bundle`_), and just want to add HyperSpyUI
and its dependencies, although it might not support older versions.
